# dk-bongo

Arduino UNO recreation of a certain accessory for a certain console. 

Meant to be used with certain games I will not mention here, but I'll say they
involve a oddly dressed simian and his equally unusual friends in their natural habitat.

As this recreation is not console-native, the game must run through a certain piece of
software whose icon resembles a certain aquatic animal.

Original copies of the games must be used! Maybe you can find some lying around on the streets or, rather, on the seven seas...
